# Abdulrahman Elsayes' Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This project is an experimental platform where I explore web development concepts using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Sass**. It's a showcase of my coding skills, creativity, and an evolving experiment where I continuously apply new techniques and design patterns.

*(Replace `https://yourwebsite.com` with the actual URL of your website)*

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes for a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Sass-Enhanced Styling**: The CSS is powered by Sass, making the styles modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. The use of variables, mixins, and partials helps to keep the code clean and organized.
- **Experimentation**: Since this is my experimental site, youâ€™ll notice I frequently update and test new layouts, animations, and design approaches as I hone my web development skills.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and semantic content.
- **CSS3**: To style the website, ensuring it looks visually appealing.
- **Sass**: To streamline and optimize the CSS workflow.
